\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Declares the \doxylink{class_training_data}{Training\+Data} class, which is responsible for reading and parsing training data from a file. 

The \doxylink{class_training_data}{Training\+Data} class provides methods to extract neural network topology, input values, and target output values from a structured training data file for training neural networks.
